## Tool Selection

I chose Replit because it provides an AI-powered, conversational development experience directly in the browser without complex setup.

## Development Process

I described the requirements of a Todo List application, and the AI generated a complete, functional project in a short time.

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was understanding the generated structure, but the AI output was clear and required minimal manual changes.

## Reflection

Vibe coding significantly accelerated development and lowered the barrier for beginners. I would use this approach again for future projects.
