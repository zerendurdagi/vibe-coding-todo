## Vibe Coding Tools Research

Vibe coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, Replit Agent, v0.dev, and Bolt.new represent a new approach to AI-assisted development.

These tools go beyond traditional code completion by understanding project context and generating complete features.

## Comparative Analysis

Traditional code completion tools only suggest small snippets of code. GitHub Copilot improves productivity but focuses on line-level suggestions. Vibe coding tools act as AI collaborators and allow developers to build applications through conversation.

Compared to using ChatGPT in a separate window, IDE-integrated AI tools reduce context switching and provide more accurate, project-aware assistance.
